Archie Table Accessories
==

This is a simple code base to create accessories to add to the rail system for the archie table. I own one table and this one works with my table, I can not guarantee that this works with your table. 

I don't have any connection (beside being a happy customer) with the [Geeknson](https://www.geeknson.co.uk/) and this is my fun project to extend my table, you can use it at your own risk and it is not something for sale. Also, this is not a one-to-one copy of the accessories and I design them with my own need in mind. of course you can modify the code or use it to fit it to your own needs. 

For all this prints, you have to enable support, and also it is a good idea to have a larger infill, my recommendation is something higher than 20%.

A simple box to hold extra things. I want to print it later, as of now, I didn't print it.

Another take on the cup holder, not yet printed it.
